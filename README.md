# Svelte Compiler Tutorial with Gun

I am starting to offer 30-60min courses on Fiverr, as of today.

For Svelte js beginners and js professionals who want to switch to Svelte, or want to come back to good "old" Typescript.

A decision which gets even rewarded with Vanilla JS code at the endðŸ¤©

But i am not teaching a language to others, after just 6 weeks of coding actively, of course, even though everybody will come with this expectation into that course.

The course i will offer is a compiler course, because thats what Svelte is. A Compiler!

And i understand the compiler already very well, just not JS yet ðŸ˜…

So its not about to change your favourite language. Its actually just about changing your compiler for JS/Typescript eventually? ðŸ˜‰ (i had to grasp that myself a few times)

Since the other options are Vanilla JS, or Typescript anyway, you can just drop your JS/Typescript file in the red box, and your HMTL file into the green box.

I just drop you the screenshot of my typical desktop as a visual helper, because you can just test in Typescript whatever you want, to get a first touch with Svelte instant!

Modify the server, test a new script, test the build and load the static files to a cdn maybe?...

Its a fresh npm create vite@latest, nothing touched but App.svelte and npm install gun

I would love to read your feedbacks on how you liked to code in Svelte your first time?
