# Svelte Compiler Tutorial with Gun

Can you code in Javascript/Typescript? Do you want Vanilla JS code at the end without learning it?ðŸ¤©

You can just drop your JS/Typescript file in the red box, and your HMTL file into the green box. (or split your js page's code into js and html and drop them into the boxes)

I just drop you the screenshot of my typical desktop as a visual helper, because you can just test in Typescript whatever you want, to get a first touch with Svelte instant!

Modify the server, test a new script, test the build and load the static files to a cdn maybe?...

Its a fresh npm create vite@latest, nothing touched but App.svelte and npm install gun

I would love to read your feedbacks on how you liked to code in Svelte your first time?
